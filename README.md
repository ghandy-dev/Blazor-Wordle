# Blazor Wordle

Blazor Wordle is clone of the popular word guessing game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). It is implemented entirely using C# and [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) (except for capturing Keyboard events, and setting the Clipboard when copying stats which both required JSInterop).
